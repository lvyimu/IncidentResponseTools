# Linux Security Response Tool

A versatile security monitoring and incident response utility for Linux systems.

## Overview

This tool provides various security monitoring and response capabilities for Linux systems, including:

- SSH brute force attack detection and IP blocking
- Webshell detection across multiple web technologies
- Log analysis for suspicious activities
- Crontab inspection for malicious scheduled tasks
- IP address search across system files

The tool is designed to assist system administrators in monitoring, detecting, and responding to potential security threats.

## Features

### üîí SSH Brute Force Protection

Monitors authentication logs for failed login attempts and automatically blocks IPs that exceed the threshold by adding them to `/etc/hosts.deny`.

### üîç Webshell Detection

Searches for common webshell signatures in web application files:

- PHP files with `eval()` or `base64_decode()` functions
- JSP files with `exec()` calls
- ASP files with `execute()` calls
- ASPX files with `eval()` functions

### üìä Log Analysis

Analyzes various system and web server logs for suspicious IP addresses or activities:

- Apache/Nginx access and error logs
- Authentication logs
- SSH secure logs

### ‚è±Ô∏è Scheduled Task Inspection

Examines crontab entries and startup scripts for potentially malicious scheduled tasks.

### üîé IP Address Search

Searches for IP addresses across system files to identify potential security issues or unauthorized configurations.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local system:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linux-security-response-tool.git
cd linux-security-response-tool
```

No additional dependencies are required beyond standard Python 3 libraries.

## Usage

```
usage: security_tool.py [-h] [-m] [-w] [-l [IP]] [-c] [-i] [-d DIRECTORIES [DIRECTORIES ...]] [-p PATTERNS [PATTERNS ...]]

Linux Security Response Tool

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m, --monitor         Monitor SSH login failures and block suspicious IPs
  -w, --webshell        Scan for potential webshells in web application files
  -l [IP], --log [IP]   Analyze logs for suspicious activities, optionally focusing on a specific IP
  -c, --crontab         Check scheduled tasks for suspicious entries
  -i, --ip-search       Search for lines containing IP addresses in system files
  -d DIRECTORIES [DIRECTORIES ...], --directories DIRECTORIES [DIRECTORIES ...]
                        Specify directories to search (default: /var/log and /etc)
  -p PATTERNS [PATTERNS ...], --patterns PATTERNS [PATTERNS ...]
                        Specify file patterns to search (default: *.log, *.conf, and hosts*)
```

### Examples

Monitor SSH login attempts and automatically block suspicious IPs:

```bash
sudo python3 security_tool.py --monitor
```

Scan web directories for potential webshells:

```bash
sudo python3 security_tool.py --webshell
```

Analyze logs for a specific suspicious IP:

```bash
sudo python3 security_tool.py --log 192.168.1.100
```

Check for suspicious scheduled tasks:

```bash
sudo python3 security_tool.py --crontab
```

Search for IP addresses in custom directories and file patterns:

```bash
sudo python3 security_tool.py --ip-search --directories /opt /home --patterns *.conf *.ini
```

## Configuration

The tool uses the following default configurations:

- SSH log file: `/var/log/secure`
- Monitored web log files:
  - `/var/log/apache2/access.log`, `/var/log/apache2/error.log`
  - `/var/log/httpd/access_log`, `/var/log/httpd/error_log`
  - `/var/log/nginx/access.log`, `/var/log/nginx/error.log`
  - `/var/log/auth.log`, `/var/log/auth.log.1`
- Hosts deny file: `/etc/hosts.deny`
- Default blocking threshold: 10 failed attempts

You can modify these settings by editing the configuration variables at the top of the script.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Root/sudo access for some features (monitoring log files, accessing protected files)
- Linux-based operating system

## Security Notes

- This tool requires appropriate permissions to access system logs and modify system files.
- Some functions may require root/sudo privileges to work properly.
- Always review changes before applying them in production environments.
